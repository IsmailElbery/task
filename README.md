## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

It's a task from ForsaThanya Company talking about check and solve PHP code which has some issues.

## üèÅ How good is this code and give a rate from 1 to 10? <a name = "rate_code"></a>
My rating to this code is 7/10.

## üöÄ Do you think the code quality has problems? if yes what are these problems? <a name = "quality_problems"></a>

About if the code quality has problems? Yes it has.

These problems are :-

-You are summoned xmlRead Class which dose not exist.

-You are summoned Item Class which dose not exist.

-You are summoned InvalidFormatException Class which dose not exist.
## ‚õèÔ∏è Refactor the code <a name = "refactor_code"></a>

-At first I created the XMl class which you are summoned it and inside this class I created a function ( getElements) to convert XML string into an object so I can loop on it.

-I created an Item Class and defined two variables which are used in the main code.

-I created a Custom Exception to handel Invalid Format File with an error message function that print the error message.

-I have edit some in the main code to handle InvalidFormatException.
